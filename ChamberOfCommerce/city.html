            <h2>Lima History</h2>
            <p>Lima, city, capital of Peru. It is the country‚Äôs commercial and industrial centre. Central Lima is
                located at an elevation of 512 feet (156 metres) on the south bank of the R√≠mac River, about 8 miles (13
                km) inland from the Pacific Ocean port of Callao, and has an area of 27 square miles (70 square km). Its
                name is a corruption of the Quechua name R√≠mac, meaning ‚ÄúTalker.‚Äù The city forms a modern oasis,
                surrounded by the Peruvian coastal desert a short distance west of the Andes Mountains. Area 1,506
                square miles (3,900 square km). Pop. (2007) metro. area, 8,472,935.</p>
            <h2>Physical and human geography</h2>


            <p>Perhaps the best clue to the significance of Lima to the country of Peru can be found in its most popular
                nickname: El Pulpo (‚ÄúThe Octopus‚Äù). Metropolitan Lima‚Äôs huge size‚Äîit accounts for about one-fourth of
                the total population of Peru‚Äîhas both resulted from and stimulated the concentration of people, capital,
                political influence, and social innovations. Lima‚Äôs unique status is but one of the more important
                consequences of a highly centralized, unitary state that from its inception in the early 19th century
                solved interregional conflicts by focusing power and prestige on the city. With its port of Callao and
                its location at the centre of Peru‚Äôs Pacific coast, Lima was long the only point of contact between the
                country and the outside world.

                As with many sprawling and rapidly growing metropolitan centres, Lima has its detractors as well as its
                promoters. Those who remember the more tranquil, traditional days, before the arrival of millions of
                migrants and before the many buses and automobiles brought pollution and congestion, are prone to use
                another nickname for the capital: Lima la Horrible. This is the noisy, dirty, gloomy, damp, and
                depressing Lima, perceptions shared by both short-term visitors and longtime residents. Even though
                sunshine does break through the dense coastal fog in the summer, Lima then becomes unbearably hot as
                well as humid, and the sunshine seems to emphasize even more clearly the grimy buildings and lack of
                greenery in the central city.</p>

                        <p>One of the first big settlements and ceremonial centers in the region was "El Para√≠so"
                            (The Paradise). The complex dates back to around 2200 BC. It is located north of the
                            City of Lima about 2 km from the Pacific Ocean directly at the Chill√≥n River and extends
                            over 50 hectares.

                        <p>The first major culture in Peru, the Chavin emerged around 1000 BC apparently in the Peruvian
                            Andes region while some archaeological findings belonging to the Chavin even can be traced
                            back
                            another 1000 years earlier. While there are many theories about the Chavin, little concrete
                            is
                            known.

                        <p>he Incas, the most well-known pre-Hispanic culture in Peru, were only the last highly
                            advanced
                            culture in a series of great ancient Peruvian civilizations. The Incas arose in the early
                            13th
                            century in the Cuzco region where they built up a small city state named Qosqo (Cuzco). They
                            originally represented one of these small and relatively minor ethnic groups, the Quechuas.
                            Gradually they began to expand and incorporate their neighbors.

                        <h3>The Independence (1821)</h3>
                        <p>By the early 19th century Lima was slowly losing its influence. Other regions of the Spanish
                            Empire in South America grew in importance and began to rebel against the Spanish
                            colonization.
                            While Spain was invaded by Napoleon and was busy defeating its borders, most Spanish
                            colonies in
                            South America took the advantage of these circumstances and sought independence, but Lima
                            stayed
                            loyal. Peru's rebellion didn't emerge from within Peru.
